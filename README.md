Healthcare Agents is a model-agnostic prompt library for healthcare administration work: revenue cycle, quality and compliance, clinical operations, payer relations, health IT, population health, pharmacy programs, operations, strategy, and emergency preparedness.

Each agent is a long-form Markdown specialist with YAML frontmatter, role-specific source awareness, compliance boundaries, operational workflows, concrete deliverable templates, best-input guidance, output modes, and cross-agent handoff rules. The pack installs into tools that support subagents, custom instructions, repository rules, or `SKILL.md` folders.

## TL;DR

| You need | Healthcare Agents gives you |
|---|---|
| Healthcare-specific agent behavior | 51 narrow specialists instead of one generic "healthcare assistant." |
| Easier agent selection | CLI chooser, task-based docs, starter prompts, output modes, and handoff maps. |
| Practical administrative output | Appeal packets, audit binders, gap analyses, dashboards, charters, payer matrices, readiness plans, and workflow checklists. |
| Better regulatory handling | Role-aware references to HIPAA, CMS, OIG, HEDIS, Stars, MIPS/QPP, HRSA 340B, NHSN, TEFCA, HL7/FHIR, X12, and other domain sources. |
| Portable installation | Claude Code agents, Claude/OpenCode skills, Codex agent prompts, Cursor/Windsurf/Copilot rules, Aider context, and plain Markdown. |
| Prompt quality controls | An included self-improvement kit with a frozen rubric, role baselines, scorer guidance, and append-only eval results. |

These agents are for healthcare administration support. They are not clinicians, attorneys, auditors, coders of record, billing authorities, or a safe PHI-processing environment. See [Trust and Safety](docs/trust-and-safety.md) for scope, PHI, human escalation, source freshness, and eval limits.

## Choose the Right Agent

Start with the task, not the agent name. Use the [agent selection guide](docs/usage/agent-selection-guide.md) when you know the operational problem, the [starter prompts](docs/usage/starter-prompts.md) when you want copy-ready examples, and the [handoff map](docs/usage/handoff-map.md) when the request spans departments.

The CLI exposes the same discovery surface:

```bash
healthcare-agents list --domain revenue
healthcare-agents show revenue-cycle-specialist
healthcare-agents choose "clean claim rate dropped after an EHR update"
healthcare-agents prompt quality-compliance-officer --mode audit/checklist
```

Every agent now supports four output modes:

| Ask for | When to use it |
|---|---|
| `quick triage` | Symptoms, weak data, or first-pass root cause analysis |
| `workplan` | Owners, sequence, dependencies, KPIs, and timeline |
| `audit/checklist` | Evidence requests, pass/fail criteria, remediation owners |
| `artifact/template` | A draft work product with assumptions and placeholders |

Common starting points:

| You need | Start with |
|---|---|
| Clean claim or denial problem | `revenue-cycle-specialist` |
| Survey readiness | `quality-accreditation-specialist` |
| Prior authorization delays | `clinical-prior-authorization-specialist` |
| ED boarding or capacity issue | `operations-hospital-administrator` |
| Interface or FHIR issue | `healthit-interoperability-engineer` |
| Value-based care performance | `payer-value-based-care-manager` |
| Safety event or RCA | `quality-patient-safety-officer` |
| CHNA or community benefit | `pophealth-community-health-coordinator` |

## Quick Examples

Claude Code:

```text
Use the revenue-cycle-specialist agent in quick triage mode to diagnose why our clean claim rate dropped, then list coding, contract, and prior authorization handoffs.
```

Codex:

```text
Read the quality-compliance-officer healthcare agent and use audit/checklist mode to draft a HIPAA Security Rule evidence checklist for a small clinic.
```

OpenCode:

```text
Use the revenue-contract-analyst skill to model payer contract underpayment risk from a sample allowed-amount table.
```

Rules-based tools:

```text
Using the healthit-interoperability-engineer instructions, review this HL7v2 interface mapping for common ADT and ORU risks.
```

Manual project install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajhcs/healthcare-agents.git
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp healthcare-agents/agents/*.md .claude/agents/
```

## Why Use This

| Generic healthcare prompting | Healthcare Agents |
|---|---|
| "Follow HIPAA." | Separates Privacy Rule, Security Rule, Breach Notification, minimum necessary, BAAs, operational evidence, and escalation boundaries. |
| "Improve revenue." | Uses CARC/RARC, 837/835, charge capture, CDM, denial prevention, payer contracts, 340B, coding, and cost-report mechanics. |
| "Check quality." | Distinguishes HEDIS, MIPS/QPP, Stars, CAHPS/HCAHPS, accreditation, patient safety, infection prevention, and QI methodology. |
| "Analyze healthcare data." | Names FHIR, HL7v2, X12, C-CDA, Epic Caboodle/Cogito, USCDI, TEFCA, eCQMs, registries, and data-lineage controls. |
| "Make an operational plan." | Produces healthcare-specific work products: appeal packets, readiness binders, staffing models, audit trails, gap analyses, and KPI dashboards. |

## Eval Status

All 51 agents have been improved through the repository's lightweight self-improvement loop.

| Pass | Agents | Average Before | Average After | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| First before/after pass | 15 | 85.0 | 93.9 | +8.9 |
| Remaining before/after pass | 36 | 85.11 | 95.50 | +10.40 |

The eval kit is intentionally simple and auditable:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.claude/commands/eval.md` | Canonical workflow for Claude Code and Codex. |
| `eval/rubric.md` | Frozen scoring rubric. |
| `eval/role-baselines/` | Expected-capability baselines for all 51 agents. |
| `eval/results.tsv` | Append-only results log. |
| `docs/eval/exam-architect-playbook.md` | Guidance for question writing and scoring behavior. |
| `docs/eval/model-tuning.md` | Model-role routing notes for current SOTA models. |
| `eval/run-logs/` | Local ignored artifacts for exact questions, scorer outputs, editor briefs, and summaries. |

Same-question before/after comparisons must preserve full Q001-Q025 artifacts before answers are generated. This keeps score deltas tied to the exact same exam rather than paraphrased weak areas.

## Self-Improvement Kit

Install the eval loop into another project that already has `agents/*.md`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajhcs/healthcare-agents.git
bash healthcare-agents/scripts/install-self-improvement-kit.sh /path/to/project
```

Run in Claude Code:

```text
/eval revenue-medical-coding-specialist
```

Run in Codex:

```text
Run the healthcare self-improvement loop for revenue-medical-coding-specialist.
```

During a normal eval run, only the requested `agents/<slug>.md` file should change, `eval/results.tsv` should only receive appended rows, and local artifacts should stay under ignored `eval/run-logs/` paths.

## Validation

Validate agent prompt structure:

```bash
bash scripts/lint-agents.sh
```

Preview installer behavior:

```bash
bash install.sh --all --dry-run
```

Check CLI help:

```bash
npx --yes healthcare-agents --help
```

## Limitations

- The agents provide healthcare administration support, not final clinical, legal, coding, billing, audit, or compliance determinations.
- Regulations, code sets, payer policies, accreditation standards, and program manuals change. Verify against current primary sources before operational use.
- The prompts do not make an AI tool HIPAA-compliant and do not create a safe PHI-processing environment. Use approved privacy, security, de-identification, and vendor-review workflows.
- Tool support differs by runtime. The installer uses best-known current file layouts and keeps plain Markdown as the fallback.
- The eval scores measure performance against this repository's rubric and role baselines; they are not external certification.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `npx healthcare-agents` cannot find the package | Use `npx --yes healthcare-agents install`, confirm network access to the npm registry, or use the GitHub-backed fallback command above. |
| Existing files are skipped | Re-run with `--force` after reviewing `--dry-run` output. |
| Your tool does not auto-discover the agents | Install to a custom path with `--path <dir>` or copy the relevant `agents/<slug>.md` file into the tool's documented rule/context folder. |
| Claude/OpenCode rejects a skill name | Use v1.1.1 or newer; agent and skill names are lowercase hyphen slugs. |
| You only want one agent | Copy the specific `agents/<slug>.md` file or generated `SKILL.md` folder manually. The installer is pack-oriented. |

## FAQ

### Are these Claude Code agents or skills?

Both. The source files in `agents/*.md` install as Claude Code subagents. The installer can also generate one `SKILL.md` folder per agent for Claude Skills, Claude Desktop/Cowork where skills are available, OpenCode, and the open `.agents/skills` convention.

### Do these work in Codex?

Yes. The installer copies prompts to `~/.codex/agents` and writes a managed `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` block telling Codex how to select and read specialists. For repo-local Codex App work, keep the prompts in the repository and reference them from `AGENTS.md`.

### Why did the frontmatter names change?

Claude Code and OpenCode expect lowercase hyphen identifiers. v1.1.1 and newer keep human labels in `display_name` while making `name` match the filename slug.

### Can I use these for HIPAA, coding, payer, or compliance work?

Use them for structured analysis, checklists, source-aware workflows, and draft deliverables. Do not treat them as final legal, clinical, coding, billing, audit, or compliance determinations.

### Can I use these with PHI?

Only inside an environment your organization has approved for PHI, with the right vendor agreements, access controls, retention settings, and de-identification practices. The prompts themselves do not solve that governance problem.

### Can I add my own agents?

Yes. Follow the conventions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), run `bash scripts/lint-agents.sh`, and keep the agent narrow, source-aware, and operationally concrete.
